# Project 1 - preliminary mix tasks



# Project 2 - balance and dynamics processing

Mix of a project from the small [scale projects for building confidence section](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk-newbies/#SmallScale). **Use only stock Reaper plugins**.

Or:

Pick one of Caleb's jazz recordings. Download it [here](https://dakotastateuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/tate_carson_dsu_edu/EmJEOi7u24JEu0Ch2EXOc3oB02JyS_hgZ1pqz7rZiJN53Q?e=H6uwM5).

This mix should include:

1. Everything from project 1
2. High-pass filter every track to remove unwanted low frequencies
3. Use item gain to adjust the volume of each track so that there is no clipping. Do this before you begin your balancing tasks.
4. After setting the item gain, set an initial mix balance with the faders.
5. Pan tracks when necessary, remembering to use the stereo pan mode when panning stereo tracks to adjust the panning and wideness.
6. Use compression to tame any tracks that are difficult to find stable fader positions for. By reducing their dynamic range, it should be easier to find a place for them in the mix.
7. Use gating to remove unwanted elements from the mix, especially spill (ex. the snare mic recorded a lot of high hat).
8. Use transient design to add back in transients that were dulled by compression or sustain to tracks that need it.

A requirement that the mix is listened to in the studio on the mains, the behritone and headphones.

Write about what differences you heard between the different speakers and how you accounted for them.

Turn in your consolidated project file to D2L.

# Project 3

<!-- Use the rubric here: [DAD 322 Final Project Rubric - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nYIMVII_1_kSKZnwc59caMSjpjRcNrvCmMJkOqts6kI/edit#gid=1386834576) -->

<!--  
Complete all mixing tasks from Projects 1 and 2, but this time for our class song. Make an arrangement out of the parts we recorded. This includes project organization, rhythmic quantization, pitch correction, EQ, balance, panning, dynamics processing and transient design.

The project can include reverb and delay. Those effects will be covered the week of March 7 onward.

It is up to you how long each part goes on for and how many parts are happening at once. Feel free to loop sections or time stretch them. Synthetic material can only be added if it reinforces something already in the mix, such as a kick enhancement or drum trigger. You may record elements to add to the song if you think they're necessary, ex. vocals.

The arrangement should be at least 3 minutes long.

Turn in a consolidated version of the mix file to D2L. If you use plugins that are not stock Reaper plugins they have to be free and cross platform (need to work for Windows and Mac).

# Project 3.5 - Teaching a lesson

Teach a 20 minute lesson on something that we have covered in the class so far. It can be a lecture style presentation with musical examples, or a discussion lead by you, or a more hands on project based lesson. We will leave 5 minutes for questions and to switch between lessons.

Turn in a few sentences about what you want to do for your lesson by Friday 4/1.

# Project 4 - final

Make a recording with at least 15 tracks and mix it using everything we have learned so far in the class. See the specific project requirements listed in the rubric [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nYIMVII_1_kSKZnwc59caMSjpjRcNrvCmMJkOqts6kI/edit?usp=sharing). -->
