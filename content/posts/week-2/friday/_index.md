## Fighting Your Own Ears in Mixing

- Your ears naturally color and adapt to sound.
- This adaptation can mislead you during mixing and affect objectivity.
- Understanding how your ears work is crucial for accurate mix evaluation.
- Knowing these quirks helps you compensate and mix more accurately.

{{% note %}}

- While the human ear's nonlinear response and adaptability are essential for daily life, they create significant challenges for maintaining objectivity during mixing.
- Your auditory system automatically balances and clarifies sounds, which can deceive you into accepting a subpar mix by masking imperfections and subtly altering your perception.
- Understanding how your ears process sound physiologically helps you recognize and counteract these biases, leading to more truthful and objective mix assessment.
- When you acknowledge and understand how your auditory system works, you can develop strategies to avoid these natural biases, resulting in a more authentic and professionally balanced mix.

## Shock Tactics for Objective Mixing

- Switch between monitoring systems frequently to prevent ear adaptation.
- Take regular breaks to restore perspective and avoid fixating on details.
- Listen to everyday sounds to recalibrate your hearing.
- A quality monitor controller makes system switching easier.

{{% note %}}

- Your ears compensate for tonal imbalances in daily life, but this same ability masks mix flaws during prolonged listening sessions. Regularly changing monitors "shocks" your auditory system, giving you a brief window of unbiased listening that reveals the mix's true character.
- Prolonged mixing sessions cause you to lose objectivity and overemphasize details. Regular breaks, unrelated activities, and everyday sounds help reset your auditory perception, giving you a fresher, more objective evaluation when you return.
- A dedicated hardware monitor controller makes switching between monitoring systems much more convenient, streamlining the process and encouraging you to use it routinely, which contributes to more accurate mixes.
- Taking breaks isn't just about physical rest—it's about mental and auditory reset. Expose yourself to natural sounds or simply change your environment. This serves as a reality check, ensuring your mix translates well outside the studio.

## Breaks and Hearing Fatigue in Mixing

- Continuous mixing fatigues your ears, especially reducing high-frequency sensitivity.
- Regular breaks maintain sharp hearing during long sessions.
- Finalize mixes after taking breaks to ensure objectivity and quality.
- Industry professionals recommend breaks for fresh perspectives and to avoid fixation.

{{% note %}}

- Extended mixing periods cause hearing fatigue, reducing your ability to accurately perceive and balance high frequencies—which are critical for a polished mix.
- Regular breaks rejuvenate your auditory sensitivity, keeping your ears sharp and capable of critical listening. This is essential for professional-level mixing.
- Don't finalize mixes late in the day—this prevents subpar outcomes. A rested, fresh perspective often reveals overlooked details or imbalances.
- Renowned engineers emphasize the importance of breaks not just for hearing health, but also for maintaining a clear distinction between technical and creative aspects of mixing. Fresh ears lead to more balanced decisions and a mix that truly represents the song's essence.

## Monitoring Level for Effective Mixing

- Mixing too loud risks hearing damage and distorts what you hear.
- Professional mix engineers recommend mixing at low to moderate volumes.
- Volume level affects how you perceive frequency balance and dynamics.
  - See [Equal-loudness contour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour)
- Mix at different volumes to understand how your mix translates across environments.

{{% note %}}

- Excessive volume during mixing causes hearing impairment and distorted perception of the mix. Monitor at reasonable levels to preserve your most critical asset as a mixer—your hearing.
- Professionals like Allen Sides and Kevin Killen recommend mixing primarily at low volumes, where you can do critical balancing effectively without risking hearing damage. Only listen at high volumes briefly for specific checks.
- The perceived frequency balance of a mix changes with monitoring volume due to equal-loudness contours (a psychoacoustic phenomenon). You need to monitor at various levels to understand how your mix translates across different listening conditions.
- Listening at different volumes provides valuable insights into how a mix performs under various conditions. However, you must also decide which volume levels are most relevant for your intended audience and musical genre, ensuring the mix retains its clarity and impact in its typical listening environment.

## A Jury of Your Peers in Mix Evaluation

- Getting external feedback is crucial for objective mix assessment.
- Even skilled mixers lose objectivity—outside perspectives are invaluable.
- Learn to filter and apply feedback constructively to improve your mixing.
- Use reference tracks to clarify vague feedback and guide adjustments.

{{% note %}}

- Professional mixing requires not just technical skill but also courage to face critique. By the end of the mixing process, your own ears are likely the least objective judge of the mix, making external feedback essential.
- Experienced mixers like Alan Moulder and Alan Parsons emphasize the value of collaboration and external input for maintaining objectivity and achieving high-quality results.
- While feedback is crucial, you must also discern which critiques are constructive and aligned with the mix's intended style versus those that reflect subjective preferences or genre-specific biases.
- When feedback seems vague or contradictory (especially from non-musicians), use reference tracks to provide a concrete basis for comparison. This helps clarify the intended direction for mix adjustments.
