## Objectives of Using Equalization

- Enhancing clarity and definition of instruments
- Amplifying the size and presence of the mix
- Harmonizing the mix by frequency range allocation

{{% note %}}

- The clarity and definition of an instrument are crucial for its distinctiveness in the mix. Equalization removes muddiness, allowing each note to be heard clearly.
- Equalization can transform a mix, giving it a 'larger than life' quality that exceeds the sum of its parts, adding depth and breadth to the sound.
- Assigning each instrument its predominant frequency range ensures a balanced mix, where every element complements rather than competes with the others. Awareness of these goals allows for more intentional and effective EQ adjustments.

## Equalization for Enhanced Definition

- Addressing lifelessness in well-recorded material through EQ
- Subtractive equalization for removing frequency maskings
- Effective frequency ranges for subtractive EQ
- The principle of minimalistic EQ application

{{% note %}}

- Overemphasis or severe attenuation of certain frequencies can diminish the vibrancy and clarity of even well-recorded source material, often necessitating EQ adjustments for improved definition.
- Subtractive EQ focuses on eliminating frequencies that obscure an instrument's clarity, particularly effective in the lower midrange (400 to 800Hz) to reduce "boxiness" and in the presence range (3kHz to 6kHz) to enhance definition.
- Two critical frequency ranges for subtractive equalization—200Hz to 600Hz and 2kHz to 4kHz—are often impacted by the proximity effect and microphone presence boosts, respectively. Adjusting these can significantly improve natural sound quality.
- Bruce Swedien's advice underscores the importance of listening before EQing, advocating for a less-is-more approach. Attenuating frequencies rather than boosting them is recommended to avoid undesirable phase shifts and maintain the natural timbre of the instruments.

## Method One: Definition 

1. Starting with your EQ flat, remove all the bottom end below 100Hz by turning the low-frequency control to full cut.
2. Using the rest of your EQ, tune the mid-upper midrange until the sound is thick yet distinct.
3. Round it out with a supporting lower-mid tone to give it some body.
4. Slowly bring up the mud-inducing bottom end enough to move air, but not so much as to make the sound muddy.
5. Add some high-frequency EQ for definition (see Figure 7.2).

{{% note %}}

- **Subtractive EQ**: Cut boxiness (400-800Hz) or enhance clarity (3-6kHz)
- **Quick fixes**: Cut at 250Hz for muddiness, 500Hz for honkiness
- **Definition**: Emphasize 2-5kHz for distinctness
- **Presence**: Boost 5-10kHz for presence
- **Strategic cutting**: Remove inessential frequencies, create "holes" for vocals
- **Technical solutions**: Position EQ in signal chain relative to compression based on dynamics needs
- **De-essing**: Control sibilance (s, sh, z, zh sounds)
- **Transient processing**: Distinguishable transients improve instrument separation

The fundamental approach emphasizes cutting over boosting and strategic removal of problematic frequencies rather than additive solutions.

## Method Two: Equalize for Size


1. Set the Boost/Cut control to a moderate level of Boost (8 or 10dB should work).
2. Sweep through the frequencies in the bass band until you find the frequency where the sound has the desired amount of fullness.
3. Adjust the amount of Boost to taste. Be aware that too much Boost will make the sound muddy.
4. Go to the frequency either half or twice the frequency that you used in Step 2 and add an amount of that frequency as well. Example: If your frequency in Step 2 was 120Hz, go to 60Hz and add a dB or so as well. If your frequency was 50Hz, go to 100Hz and add a bit there (see Figure 7.3).

{{% note %}}
To equalize for size:

- **Add bass (40-250Hz)** to create larger-than-life sounds, focusing around 100Hz
- **Sweep technique**: Boost 8-10dB in low frequencies and find the ideal fullness point
- **Create space** for bass instruments by keeping other elements from competing in their fundamental range
- **Differentiate kick and bass** with contrasting EQ treatments to maintain clarity
- **Manage low-end density** based on pattern complexity - less "woof" for busy patterns, more for spacious ones
- **Use reverb/delay** to increase perceived size of both individual instruments and the entire mix

## Key Trouble Frequency Areas in Mixing

- 200Hz: Mud
- 300 to 500Hz: Boxiness
- 800Hz: "Cheap" Sound
- 1k to 1.5kHz: Nasality
- 4kHz to 6kHz: Presence
- 10kHz+: Air

{{% note %}}

- The 200Hz area is critical for achieving the right balance between fullness and clarity. Excess can lead to a muddy mix, while too little may result in a thin sound.
- Frequencies between 300 and 500Hz are notorious for causing boxiness, particularly noticeable in lower quality microphones and certain drums, often requiring careful reduction.
- The 800Hz range is associated with a cheap, tinny sound reminiscent of low-quality speakers, necessitating careful adjustment to avoid an overly "budget" audio quality.
- Vocal tracks often suffer in the 1k to 1.5kHz range, leading to a nasal sound. Adjusting this range can significantly improve vocal clarity and naturalness.
- The presence range (4kHz to 6kHz) is essential for definition and clarity. Underutilization leads to a dull sound, while overemphasis can cause harshness or sibilance.
- Frequencies above 10kHz add "air" and a sense of space to recordings, enhancing realism and breathiness, especially important in vintage microphone recordings or to simulate such a quality with modern gear.

## Essential EQ Techniques and Tips

- Adjusting Q values for precision in EQ adjustments
- EQ strategies for mixing placement and texture
- Managing instrument presence in varying mix densities
- The art of subtle EQ enhancements
- Balancing solo and mix contexts for instrument EQ

{{% note %}}

- Using a narrow Q for cutting helps isolate and remove specific problem frequencies without affecting the surrounding sound, while a wide Q for boosting gently enhances a broader range, ensuring a more natural effect.
- Rolling off the bottom end can help an instrument cut through the mix by reducing muddiness, whereas rolling off the top end can help it blend better by softening its presence.
- In arrangements with fewer instruments, allowing each instrument more sonic space can lead to a fuller, richer sound. Conversely, in dense mixes, scaling back the presence of each instrument is crucial for clarity and cohesion.
- Applying modest EQ boosts at two different frequencies can provide a more balanced enhancement than a significant boost at a single frequency, leading to a more nuanced sound.
- An instrument may sound excellent on its own when EQ'd in isolation, but it's important to ensure that these adjustments still allow it to sit well within the full context of the mix, highlighting the importance of contextual EQ adjustments.

# Achieving Vocal Depth and Clarity with EQ

- **Subtractive EQ:** Cut boxiness (200-800Hz) and problem resonances (2-4kHz)
- **High-Frequency Boosts:** Enhance presence (4-6kHz) and air (10kHz+) for definition
- **EQ on Effects:** Scoop mids (2kHz) in reverbs/delays; roll off below 200Hz/above 10kHz
- **De-essing:** Compress sibilant frequencies (3-10kHz) for smooth "S" sounds
{{% note %}}

To achieve vocal depth and clarity using EQ, consider techniques such as subtractive equalization, boosting high frequencies, utilizing EQ curves on reverbs and delays, and addressing sibilance.

Key techniques to consider:

*   **Subtractive Equalization**: Reduce frequencies that mask definition, especially in the lower midrange (400Hz to 800Hz), which can add a "boxy" quality. You can sweep through frequencies between 200Hz and 600Hz, as well as between 2kHz and 4kHz, to find the areas to cut.
*   **Boosting High Frequencies**: Add high-frequency EQ for definition. The 4kHz to 6kHz range (presence) is often underutilized and can prevent a track from sounding dull. Too much, however, can make the vocal sound thin. Also, frequencies above 10kHz (air) can add clarity and "realness".
*   **EQ Curves on Reverbs and Delays**: When using reverb on vocals, create an EQ scoop in the midrange around 2kHz to keep the effect out of the way of the vocal's consonants. You can roll off the high and low ends of the frequency spectrum around 200Hz and 10kHz to prevent muddiness or excessive prominence. To make an effect stand out, brighten it up; to make it blend, darken it by filtering out the highs.
*   **De-essing**: Use a de-esser to compress the "S" frequencies, which typically fall between 3kHz and 10kHz, to combat sibilance. This can be done either with dedicated hardware or software, or by using a compressor with an equalizer plugged into the sidechain.

Additional techniques and considerations:

*   **Enhancing Consonants**: Accentuate consonants by boosting 2kHz to 4kHz, which makes the vocal seem closer.
*   **Dealing with problem resonances**: Dynamic EQ can contain sporadic, narrow-bandwidth frequency peaks, which can help when a singer creates different timbres and vowel sounds.
*   **Creating space for vocals**: Reduce the levels of cymbal frequencies above 5kHz or exaggerate those frequencies in the vocal sound to retain the same vocal sound against cymbals.
*   **EQ for Distance**: Brighter sounds are perceived as closer, while duller sounds are perceived as farther away.
*   **Mono Compatibility**: When widening the vocal's stereo image, ensure it remains mono-compatible.
