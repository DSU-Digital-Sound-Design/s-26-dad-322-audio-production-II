**Event Horizon Limiter/Clipper**
   - **Function**: Acts as both a limiter and clipper to control peak levels and prevent distortion.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Ideal for taming transients and ensuring that drum peaks don't cause clipping, maintaining a punchy yet controlled drum sound.

**Fairly Childish Compressor/Limiter**
   - **Function**: A versatile compressor/limiter designed to manage dynamic range.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Provides transparent compression, allowing drums to glue together cohesively without losing their natural dynamics.

**Fairly Childish Stereo Compressor/Limiter**
   - **Function**: Stereo version of the Fairly Childish Compressor/Limiter, aimed at processing stereo signals.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Ensures balanced compression across the stereo field, maintaining the spatial integrity of stereo drum recordings.

**Master Limiter**
   - **Function**: A mastering-grade limiter designed to maximize loudness while preventing clipping.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Useful for achieving a louder drum mix without introducing distortion, ensuring the drum bus sits well in the overall mix.

**MGA JS Limiter**
   - **Function**: A peak limiter aimed at controlling transient spikes in audio signals.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Effective in managing unexpected peaks, keeping the drum dynamics in check without affecting the overall punch.

**MGA JS Limiter (Unlinked Stereo)**
   - **Function**: A variant of the MGA JS Limiter that processes left and right channels independently.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Allows for independent limiting of each channel, which can be beneficial if the stereo drum mix has uneven dynamics between the left and right channels.

**NP1136 Peak Limiter**
   - **Function**: Designed to manage and limit peak levels in audio signals.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Provides smooth and transparent peak limiting, ensuring that drum hits remain powerful without causing distortion.

**Simple Peak-1 Limiter**
   - **Function**: A basic peak limiter for controlling maximum signal levels.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Offers straightforward peak control, suitable for quick fixes to prevent clipping in the drum mix.

**Soft Clipper/Limiter**
   - **Function**: Combines soft clipping and limiting to manage peaks and add harmonic saturation.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Adds warmth and subtle saturation to the drum bus, enhancing the overall tonal character while controlling peaks.

**Turquoise Limiter S2 (Tukan)**
   - **Function**: A limiter plugin designed for precise control over dynamic range.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Offers detailed limiting options, allowing for fine-tuning of drum dynamics to achieve a polished and cohesive sound.

**VariBus Comp S2 (Tukan)**
   - **Function**: A JSFX plugin for REAPER that emulates classic analog variable-mu compressors, providing smooth and musical dynamic control with a warm tonal character.
   - **Application on Drum Bus**: Enhances cohesion and punch by gluing individual drum elements together, delivering a unified and polished drum sound.
