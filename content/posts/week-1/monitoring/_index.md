## Why Accurate Monitoring Matters

- Reliable hearing is essential for effective mixing
- Professional techniques work in less-than-ideal spaces
- Objective listening decisions matter more than equipment quality
- Poor mixes often result from hearing problems, not technique problems

{{% note %}}

- Reliable hearing is essential for audio mixing. Without accurate auditory feedback, efforts in mixing can be counterproductive, leading to mixes that don't translate well across different playback systems.
- Professional engineers often have access to high-end equipment and acoustically treated spaces, but many also excel in less ideal conditions. Adopting their tactics can be beneficial even in small, less equipped studios.
- The ability to make objective decisions about audio, such as EQ adjustments or vocal clarity, is crucial. This skill goes beyond the capabilities of the equipment used.
- Many who struggle with their mixes believe their techniques are at fault. However, the root issue often lies in not being able to accurately hear or interpret what is being heard.

## Choosing Studio Monitors

- Quality monitors provide accurate frequency response (but cost more)
- Smaller nearfield monitors often outperform large speakers for mixing
- Focus on stereo quality over surround sound on limited budgets
- Avoid hi-fi speakers—use active/powered monitors instead
- Get familiar with your specific monitors through reference tracks

{{% note %}}

- Choosing the right equipment for monitoring is crucial as it provides the primary feedback for all mixing decisions. Quality monitoring systems, which offer a clear and even frequency response, are often expensive but vital for accurate audio representation.
- Volume isn't as critical as audio quality in studio monitors. Famous mix engineers often prefer smaller, nearfield monitors for a more accurate sound, rather than large, powerful speakers.
- For small studios, it's advisable to focus on achieving high-quality stereo sound rather than investing in a complex surround setup, especially when working with a limited budget.
- Hi-fi speakers, designed to enhance audio, aren't ideal for studio work where identifying flaws in a mix is essential. Active or powered speakers are a better choice due to their convenience and built-in amplification tailored to the speaker's design.
- Monitor choice is subjective, and getting accustomed to the specific sound of your chosen monitors is part of the learning process. Familiarity with your monitors, aided by reference recordings, is key to effective mixing.

## Studio Monitor Anatomy

![](studio-monitor-anatomy.png)

{{% note %}}

- Cabinet: Houses speaker electronics (metal, wood, or plastic)
- Two drivers:
  - Tweeter: Produces high frequencies (above ~2 kHz) using cone or dome shapes
  - Woofer: Produces low and mid-range frequencies in two-way monitors

## Active vs Passive Monitors

![](active-vs-passive.png)

{{% note %}}

- Passive monitors: Require external amplifier → signal amplified → crossover network → drivers
- Active monitors: Built-in amplifiers → signal passes through crossover first → each frequency band amplified separately → drivers
- Active speakers are more convenient (no external equipment needed)

## Nearfield Monitoring

![](near-field-vs-far-field-monitors.png)

{{% note %}}

- Monitors are the most important part of your mix environment—worth the investment
- Nearfield monitors: Smaller drivers placed 2-3 feet from listener
- Proximity advantage: More direct sound reaches your ears, less room reflection
- Result: Higher ratio of direct-to-reflected sound = more accurate monitoring

## What are the mains for?

> "There just aren't many situations where the main monitors sound all that good," says Chuck Ainlay. "The mains in most studios are intended primarily for hyping the clients and playing real loud."

> "I don't use the big monitors in studios for anything," says Nigel Godrich, "because they don't really relate to anything."

{{% note %}}

- Chuck Ainlay: Grammy-winning mix engineer known for work with Mark Knopfler, Dire Straits, Vince Gill, and countless Nashville artists. His point: large main monitors are more about impressing clients than accurate mixing.
- Nigel Godrich: Producer/engineer for Radiohead, Beck, Paul McCartney, and U2. Known for his innovative production techniques and preference for nearfield monitoring during actual mixing work.
- Key takeaway: Even world-class engineers with access to the best equipment prefer smaller nearfield monitors for critical mixing decisions. Large mains don't translate well to how most people listen to music.

{{< note >}}

- Firmly fix speaker cabinets—movement distorts low-end representation
- Use dedicated speaker stands (better than desks/shelves)
- Stands offer better sound quality and easy repositioning
- Avoid heavy-duty wall brackets unless space requires them

## Speaker Positioning Essentials

- Aim speakers directly at listening position for accurate high frequencies
- Phase and comb filtering alter sound when signals misalign
- Vertical alignment prevents comb filtering at crossover frequencies
- Driver misalignment affects critical mid-range (vocals, snare drums)

{{% note %}}

- Precise speaker positioning is essential. Speakers should be aimed directly at the listening position to ensure accurate high-frequency reproduction, as high frequencies are more directional and can be obscured by obstacles.
- Phase and comb filtering significantly affect audio quality. When two identical audio signals are slightly out of alignment, phase cancellation occurs, altering the sound's tonality. This effect is especially pronounced with complex, real-world sounds like music.
- Vertical alignment of speakers is crucial due to the waveguide effect and the positioning of multiple drivers in nearfield monitors. Misalignment can result in comb filtering, particularly around crossover frequencies, affecting mid-range frequencies.
- Comb filtering is a critical issue in two-driver nearfield monitors. Misalignments between the woofer and tweeter can cause frequency cancellations in the sensitive mid-frequency range, impacting critical sound elements like vocals and snare drums.
