These notes go with *“5 References For Low End …and why they're so useful!”*

[Low-end mixing references](../CambridgeMT_5BassReferences.pdf)

## Why we’re doing this
Low end is the hardest part of mixing to “trust,” especially in a small room. It’s really common to have a mix where the vocals and instruments feel solid, but the bass either disappears on small speakers or explodes on big ones.

That’s why reference tracks matter. They help you:
- sanity-check your monitoring (speakers + room + listening position)
- make low-end decisions in context (instead of guessing)
- level up your ears by comparing against mixes that translate everywhere

## How to listen
- Keep your listening level consistent (and not too loud).
- Don’t just “enjoy the song” — pick one thing to focus on for a minute:
  - Where does the kick live: deep thump, upper punch, or both?
  - Is the bass more sub, more note definition, or a blend?
  - When the chorus hits, does the low end get bigger, tighter, or both?
  - Can you still follow the bass line on small speakers?
- When you’re mixing, go back and forth: reference → your mix → reference. Short comparisons beat long ones.

## Mike's references
**Calvin Harris feat. Kelis: “Bounce”**: A great example of kick and bass working together without stepping on each other. Notice how the kick feels punchy and clear, but the low end never turns into a blurry “boom.” Also pay attention to how well it still hits on smaller playback systems.

**Christine & The Queens: “Christine”**: Super useful as a “monitor check” because there’s a lot going on down low. It’s a good test for whether your speakers (and room) can keep bass elements clean instead of smearing them together.

**Post Malone: “Circles”**: A nice reminder that “good low end” isn’t just sub-bass — it’s also how the kick and bass read across the whole spectrum. Listen for how the low end stays balanced with the arrangement, and how consistent it feels across different playback situations.

**Sting: “All Four Seasons”**: A classic low-end reference that’s useful in a lot of different rooms. It’s also a good one for thinking about mono compatibility and how midrange energy changes your perception of kick and bass.

**Anderson .Paak: “Lockdown”**: Smooth but powerful low end — it hits hard without feeling harsh. If you know the sub-heavy vibe of older references (like Dr. Dre’s *2001* era), this is a more modern version of that feel.

## My list
Here are a few of my go-to references. Add yours as we go this semester (especially tracks you know really well).
