title: "Tuning and Aligning Vocals"

### Overview

This page focuses on two essential aspects of vocal production: tuning and aligning vocals. We'll be practicing these skills using Benjamin John's song "Better Way". First, we'll tune the vocals using the ReaTune plugin, ensuring they are in the correct key and pitch-perfect. Then, we'll align the background vocals with the lead vocal.

### Preparing the Track

**Download the Track**: Start by downloading the shorter edit of Benjamin John's [Better Way](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk-newbies/#BenjaminJohn) to use in your class.

### Tuning Vocals with ReaTune

#### Setting Up ReaTune

- **Add ReaTune Plugin**: Add the ReaTune plugin to your lead vocal track.
- **Determine the Song Key**:
   - Use the tuner in ReaTune to figure out the key of the song. For most pop songs, this should be straightforward.
   - Once you know the key, navigate to the correction tab and select it. This will help you identify out-of-tune notes.

#### Configuring ReaTune

- **Set Attack Time**: Adjust the attack time to at least 50 ms to avoid an overly auto-tuned sound.
- **Mono or Stereo**: If your vocal is mono, disable stereo correction.
- **Choose Algorithm**: Set the algorithm to _elastique 3.3.3 Pro_ for the best quality.

#### Manual Correction

- **Track Pitch**: Go to the manual correction tab, select "track pitch," and play through the section you want to correct. Aim to capture a complete melodic phrase that's not too lengthy.
- **Zoom In**: Use your mouse wheel and cmd + mouse wheel to zoom into the captured vocals.
- **Begin Tuning**: Select "Manual Correction."
   - It's beneficial to have a keyboard nearby to check the intended notes of the melody.
   - Drawn in a blue line to indicate the correct pitch. The line should snap to the nearest note. 
   - Correct the pitch manually, ensuring you don't over-tune and lose the natural quality of the vocals.

### Vocal Alignment

- **Understand the Recording**: This track includes a double-tracked vocal, with the second track slightly out of time with the lead vocal.
- **Marking the Words**:
   - If you're not familiar with the song, it can be helpful to add markers at the start of every word. Write down the lyrics to help you identify new words in the waveform.
   - To better see the phrases, increase the peak size by pressing _shift + up_. This won't alter the volume of the track.

#### Using Dynamic Split

- **Prepare for Splitting**:
   - Select all vocal tracks except the lead vocal.
   - Bring up "Dynamic Split" (shortcut: D).
- **Configure Settings**:
   - The transient detection may not work perfectly due to the minimal level difference between the transient and silence.
   - Use _when gate opens_ and _when gate closes_ options to place markers at the start and end of the words.
   - Add stretch markers to selected items and review your tracks.

### Editing Stretch Markers

- **Moving Markers**:
   - Configure your mouse modifier preferences for moving stretch markers as shown in the instructions.

- **Deleting Markers**:
   - To delete a stretch marker, use _option + click_ on Mac.

- **Adding Markers**:
   - To add a stretch marker, use _option + command_ on Mac.
- **Bulk Marker Removal**:
   - To remove multiple markers, select the item, make a time selection over the markers, and then choose the appropriate option to remove them.

### Backing Vocals

- Now align the backing vocals with the lead and the bass. Add stretch markers to the beginning and end of each word. I would add stretch markers to each track separately so that you make sure each word has the correct stretch marker placement. Then group them and move the stretch markers on all backing vocals to align the words together. 

#### Finalizing Alignment

- **Group Your Vocals**: After editing, group your vocals together.
- **Aligning**: Move the stretch markers of one vocal track, and the corresponding markers in the grouped tracks will align automatically.
- **Attention to Detail**: Remember, aligning vocals is not automatic. It requires patience, time, and a keen ear to detail.
